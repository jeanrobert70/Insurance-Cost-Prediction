# Health Insurance Premium Prediction with Machine

In this project, I created an app that predicts insurace premium using Machine Learning. The dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bbhatt001/predictors-of-medical-expenses/data. It contains the following features:

* the age of the person
* gender of the person
* Body Mass Index of the person
* how many children the person is having
* whether the person smokes or not
* the region where the person lives
* and the charges of the insurance premium
